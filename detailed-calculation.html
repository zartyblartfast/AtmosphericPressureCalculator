<h2>Understanding the Calculation Method</h2>
<p>Our Atmospheric Pressure Calculator uses a well-established scientific method to estimate air pressure at different altitudes. This method combines the barometric formula and the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model. These models take into account various factors such as altitude, temperature, and the physical properties of air to provide an accurate estimation of atmospheric pressure.</p>

<h2>Our Verification Process</h2>
<p>We've taken steps to ensure the accuracy of our calculations. The calculation method has been thoroughly reviewed and cross-referenced with established scientific models and formulas. We've tested the calculator with a variety of inputs to ensure it works correctly and provides reliable results.</p>
